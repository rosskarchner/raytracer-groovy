# raytracer-groovy

I'm working through [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge) and learning Groovy at the same time-- I intend on improving the quality of the code, but it is pretty messy at the moment.

If you have a sane Groovy environment, you should be able to run the tests with `gradle test`.
